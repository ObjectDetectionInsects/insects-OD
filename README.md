# Insects object detection project overview 

In this quick read-me I will go over 3 subjects 
1. Config parameters behavior
2. How to prepare data for detection and classification 
3. Projects flow and output behavior


### Config behavior 
- everything related to the way in which different parameters change the behavior of the project

See indepth explanations [here](workspace/projUtils/CONFIGBEHAVIOR.MD)

### preparing the data for detection
- everything related to transforming the input files to expected format 

See indepth explanations [here](workspace/projUtils/UTILS.MD)

### Projects flow and output behavior
