# Conventional branch naming

## Branch Formats

</font><b><a href="#scopes"><kla-user-name>/<type>/<feature-name></a></b>

###Kebab case

Use a branch name with kebab case which means dashes.

###Examples:

* add-login-button (kebab case)


### Types

* `wip` Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon
* `feat` Feature I'm adding or expanding
* `bug` Bug fix
* `exp` Experiment
* `junk` Throwaway branch created to experiment
* `devops` Feature I'm adding or expanding on devops section



### Examples

* ori-sh/feat/add-data-convolution
* ori-sh/bug/fix-ido-ya-bug

### Slash separator

Use a slash "/" to simulate a directory and subdirectory.

Examples:

* wip/login-button
* feat/table-layout
* junk/page-speed

Benefits: if you use a git GUI client that treats a slash "/" as a directory separator, then you may enjoy this kind of organization.
